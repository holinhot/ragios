###Ragios (Saint Ruby)

While reading the book “Nagios: system and Network Monitoring” by Wolfgang Barth, I thought it will be a good idea to write a Ruby based System Monitoring tool similar to Nagios.

So I started writing such a tool. Since it was inspired by Nagios, I will call it Ragios (Ruby Agios) aka Saint Ruby since Agios is Saint in Greek.

This is all just for fun and educational purposes. Ruby makes programmers more productive, a longterm goal of this project is to make system monitoring fun and more productive.

Ragios could be used to monitor any type of system including servers, workstations, switches, routers, system services and applications, locally or over a network. The system admin can define the tests he wants to run on the system or re-use tests written by other developers. The tests run periodically on the system. When a test fails the admin receives an email or SMS alert.
